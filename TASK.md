# Task: Hitler crawler

> You may know a joke that says each dialog will end with a discussion about Hitler.
> Let’s check it on Wikipedia. You should create a program that receives a Wikipedia 
> article and scans it for other Wikipedia links, opens them, and scans for links until
> it finds the link to [Hitler Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler).

### Task
* Write a console application for searching the Hitler Wikipedia page presented [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler). 
* Input is a link to some Wikipedia page 
* Output is the path to the Hitler page, if the page is not found in 6 hops just write into the console “Hitler not found” 
* Try to optimize the search for multiple usages 
* Try to optimize search by parallelization

### Result
* Publish code on github
* In README.md place all the explanations about how to run code and additional info.
